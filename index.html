        <p>As a student at Liberty University, my plan is to graduate with a bachelor's degree in a technological field of study. In order to accomplish this plan, I needed to choose a major of technological expertise. The major that I had chosen originally was Studio and Digital Arts with a minor in graphic design. However, both the major and minor were based upon hand drawn designs with technological programs aiding the developmental artists in their final creations. For this reason, I lost interest in my previous major and switch to a new one that was more technological and programmable. After spending the entire fall semester of 2017 in the previous major, I transitioned from Studio and Digital Arts to Information Technology in the Spring 2018 semester.
            
        <p>Now, with an Information Technology degree, I decided to minor in web and mobile programming because I wanted to learn more about computer software than computer hardware in order to create mobile applications and web pages. As I continue to progress through my major, I always wanted to learn how web pages interact with client computers and web servers. The reason that I am less interested in learning computer hardware now is because I was already self-taught due to my previous experiences of fixing personal computers at a younger age. </p>
        
        <p>In order to fix different components on these computational devices, I read instruction manuals on personal computers, troubleshoot routers and modems, and disconnect televisions along with landline phones so that they can be reconnected properly into their respective sockets. My goal in fixing each computer device is to discover how each of the components worked with the device and then put the device back together again after it had fallen apart. With collegiate knowledge in information technology, I hope to help others with their technological needs in the near future.</p>
        
        <p>After graduating from Liberty University, I plan on using my bachelor's degree to help small businesses and ministries gain more public exposure through build mobile applications and developing web pages for them. My parents and mentors let me know that I have a strong work ethnic and a willingness to learn things that I am interested in. I am enjoying my current major and believe that this major is the calling that God has chosen for me to fulfill His plans for my life.</p>
